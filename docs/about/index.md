# About GeeAdvance

**GeeAdvance** is a project dedicated to bridging the gap between cloud-scale remote sensing and landscape ecology.

## The Mission

Our mission is to provide an accessible, high-performance toolkit for researchers to analyze spatial patterns directly within the Google Earth Engine ecosystem, while maintaining the statistical rigor of established tools like FRAGSTATS and the R `landscapemetrics` package.

## Core Values

- **Accessibility**: Lowering the barrier to entry for GEE-based landscape analysis.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensuring that analysis workflows can be easily shared and repeated.
- **Performance**: Leveraging both cloud and local processing for optimal speed.

## The Team

GeeAdvance is developed and maintained by **Pulakesh Pradhan**.
